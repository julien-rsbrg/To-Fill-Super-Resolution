# Super-Resolution

The goal of this repository is to give a structure to the implementation of SRGAN (Ledig et al., 2017). 
The link to this article is here : https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802

What you will need to do :

- Put the dataset in a folder and move it next to these scripts

- Complete the SRGAN script



An example of what I managed to get :
<img src="ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif"
     alt="Example GIF"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />
